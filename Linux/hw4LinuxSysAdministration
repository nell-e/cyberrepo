sudo adduser --system --no-create-home amy
sudo adduser --system --no-create-home sara
Force users to create 16-character passwords incorporating numbers and symbols.

sudo nano pwquality.conf


Updates to configuration file: 
minlen = 16


Force passwords to expire every 90 days.


Command to to set each new user's password to expire in 90 days (include all five users): 
sudo chage -M 90 admin 
sudo chage -M 90 sam 
sudo chage -M 90 joe
 sudo chage -M 90 amy
 sudo chage -M 90 sara

Ensure that only the admin has general sudo access.


Command to add admin to the sudo group: 
sudo usermod -aG sudo admin
Step 3: Create User Group and Collaborative Folder

Command to add group: 
sudo addgroup engineers
Add users sam, joe, amy, and sara to the managed group.


Command to add users to engineers group (include all four users): 
sudo usermod -aG engineers sam 
sudo usermod -aG engineers joe
 sudo usermod -aG engineers amy 
sudo usermod -aG engineers sara
Create a shared folder for this group at /home/engineers.


Command to create the shared folder: 
sudo mkdir -p /home/engineers
Change ownership on the new engineers' shared folder to the engineers group.


Command to change ownership of engineer's shared folder to engineer group: sudo chgrp -R engineers /home/engineers
Step 4: Lynis Auditing
Command to install Lynis: 
sudo apt install lynis


Command to see documentation and instructions: 
man lynis


Command to run an audit:
