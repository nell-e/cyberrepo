Visitorâ€™s traffic originated from Facebook
This event appears to be a user downloading a Linux package from the website being monitored.
Linux packages are not typically malicious but they could be. Depending on the website, this could be harmless traffic from a sysadmin performing an update.
The main concern is the referral link from Facebook, as it's probably not within compliance to post package update links on Facebook.
This user could be further investigated and monitored for suspicious activity.
